# Waveform Clock Animation

## Overview
WaveformClockAnimation is an innovative Android application that showcases a dynamic clock animation using Jetpack Compose. This project highlights the power of Jetpack Compose for creating complex and visually appealing UI components with ease. The clock animation represents time in a waveform style, providing a unique and engaging visual experience.

## Features
### Dynamic Clock Animation
Displays the current time with a continuously updating waveform animation.
### Jetpack Compose
Leverages Jetpack Compose for creating the UI, making the codebase modern, concise, and easy to maintain.
### Smooth Performance
Ensures smooth and fluid animations for a delightful user experience.
### Customizable
Easy to modify and extend the animation and UI components to fit different styles and requirements.

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/priyachauhan2003/WaveformClockAnimation.git
```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
* Open Android Studio.
* Click on `File -> Open` and select the cloned repository.

3. Build the project.
* Ensure you have the necessary SDKs and dependencies installed.

2. View the Clock: The main screen will display the current time with a waveform animation.
3. Enjoy the Animation: Watch as the waveform dynamically updates to reflect the passing time.

## Jetpack Compose Integration
WaveformClockAnimation is built entirely using Jetpack Compose, Android's modern toolkit for building native UI. This allows for a declarative approach to UI development, resulting in more readable and maintainable code.

## Key Components
* Composable Functions: Core building blocks for the UI, defining the structure and behavior of the clock animation.
* State Management: Efficiently manages the state to ensure the clock updates in real-time.
* Canvas API: Utilized for drawing custom waveform graphics on the screen.
